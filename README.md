# ReallyRelease

Why use -retainCount when you can automate the whole process?

##  No, but really?

No, not really. It was written as part of an [April 1st update](http://www.whentouseretaincount.com/index-always.html) to my [WhenToUseRetainCount](http://www.whentouseretaincount.com) website. Needless to say, I don't recommend using this code, except in the case of people on Stack Overflow that really, _really_ won't be convinced that using `retainCount` is a bad idea.

Anyway, it's possibly a good example of how not to use method swizzling.
